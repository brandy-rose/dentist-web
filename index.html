         <p>I desperately needed dentures and I am on MassHealth. A cloud hangs over the people who are on MassHealth and the providers of their services. There are no words to describe how WONDERFUL my experience with Pleasant Street Dental is with Dr. Meena and her staff! Greeted with respect, dignity and a deep desire to provide the best possible care for her patients and their many, diverse needs. Fitting dentures to an individual is quite a daunting challenge to say the least. Patience, persistents and perseverance is what it takes with each individual and Dr. Meena and her staff come through with flying colors! Alway's warm and welcoming and not satisfied until their patient is happy with whatever work may have been needed! My gratitude for Dr. Meena and her staff goes beyond the stars! There is no other dentist I would go to or recommend! When you find the best, you keep it! Sincerely, Susan Mara</p>

         <p>We had a very pleasant experience with Dr. Meena and her staff. My daughter was very anxious about the appointment and any procedure, but Dr. Meena was very patient with her and spend a lot of time trying to calm her down, the staff was very helpful and kind and always available to help. Dr. Meena is very professional, she takes the time to explain what needs to be done and provides valuable advice , It's not easy to find a good dentist for your kids, I highly recommend Dr. Meena and her staff for kids and adults.</p>
